    "### 10 Prompt Engineering Tips (Short Version)\n",
    "Be Clear:\n",
    "Use specific and precise instructions. Example: \"Summarize in 2 sentences.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Define Output Format:\n",
    "Request structured responses like bullet points, JSON, or HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask for a Self-Check:\n",
    "Add checks like: \"If unsure, respond with 'No information.'\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Delimiters or Tags:\n",
    "Separate instructions and context clearly to avoid confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role Prompting:\n",
    "Assign a role to the model to adjust style and tone, e.g., \"Act as a mathematician.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Limit Context:\n",
    "Use only the most relevant parts of a document to improve response accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show Examples:\n",
    "Provide examples to guide the model toward desired responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask for Explanation:\n",
    "Request reasoning to improve accuracy, especially for logical tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide Step-by-Step Instructions:\n",
    "Include detailed steps or examples for better problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Split Tasks:\n",
    "Break complex tasks into smaller subtasks (prompt chaining) for more control."

    "## Types of Prompting with Examples \n",
    "1. Zero-Shot Prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask a task without examples.\n",
    "Example: \"Translate this to French: Hello.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One-Shot Prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide one example before the task.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"Translate: 'Hello -> Bonjour'. Now, translate: 'Goodbye'.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Few-Shot Prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide a few examples to guide the model.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"Translate: 'Hello -> Bonjour', 'Cat -> Chat'. Now, translate: 'Dog'.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Chain-of-Thought Prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encourage step-by-step reasoning.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"Calculate: If 5 apples cost $10, what is the cost of 2 apples? Step-by-step, first find the cost of 1 apple...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Role-Based Prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign a role to influence tone or expertise.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"You are a teacher. Explain Python functions to beginners.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Instruction-Based Prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide detailed instructions for specific output.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"Summarize the text in 3 bullet points.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Interactive Prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use iterative inputs for clarification or refinement.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"Rewrite this text to make it formal. If unclear, ask questions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Prompt Chaining:\n",
    "\n",
    "Break tasks into smaller parts.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"First, generate a title. Then create an outline. Finally, write the content.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Contextual Prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide relevant context for better responses.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"Based on the given paragraph, summarize it in one sentence.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Multimodal Prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use text along with other inputs like images.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"Describe the attached image in one sentence.\""
